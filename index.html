				<p> Hello! My name is Jang. I was born and raised in Thailand. I moved to Chicago in January 2011. It was a few days before a blizzard hit Chicago. I thought that was completely normal.</p>
				
				<p>I love travelling. I went to 6 countries plus Hawaii, Alaska and New York City in the past 12 months. Iceland was my most favorite of all. I had never been to a place that beautiful in my life!</p>
			

				<p>I enjoy my Coding Boot Camp program a lot. It gives joy from doing something I've always loved; problem solving. Time flies when I am doing this. It's been a lot of fun!</p>
